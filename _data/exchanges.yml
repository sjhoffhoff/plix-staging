      <a href="https://databasic.io/">DataBasic.io</a> is a suite of tools and activities to help people understand and work with data, a valuable skill set in this age of data and visualization. Activities include hands-on workshops developed to help people learn data literacy concepts in safe, engaging, familiar ways.
    - >
      Through this residency exchange, the DataBasic.io team will iterate on existing workshops and design new ones in collaboration with <a href="http://www.sppl.org/">Saint Paul Public Library</a>, an active community hub for supporting data and information literacy skills. During the residency, the team will develop documentation and toolkits for their activities, identify topics and data sets best for introductions in the library setting, and incorporate data literacy resources into existing library programming.

      The <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/open-agriculture-openag/overview/">MIT Open Agriculture Initiative</a> brings together partners from industry, government, and academia to collaborate on the creation of an open-source ecosystem of technologies, such as the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/build-a-food-computer/">Food Computer</a>, to enable and promote transparency, networked experimentation, education, and hyper-local production.
    - >
      This residency exchange is centered around the building of a <a href="https://wiki.openag.media.mit.edu/mvp_1">MVP 1.0</a> Food Computer at both <a href="http://www.akronlibrary.org/">Akron-Summit County Public Library</a> and the <a href="https://www.freelibrary.org/">Free Library of Philadelphia</a>, with the help of the OpenAg community, to augment existing food and agriculture initiatives and activities at each library. The teams will provide feedback on the Food Computer build process and documentation, as well as a new suite of programming and tools for libraries to engage their communities in food and agriculture activities.

      The <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/playful-words/overview/">Playful Words</a> team is designing tools for children to develop skills in self-expression, literacy, and dialog through natural mediums of written language, pictures, and stories. This group is working with <a href="http://www.bpl.org/">Boston Public Library</a> to gain an understanding of how to integrate <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/storyblocks/overview/">StoryBlocks</a> and other Playful Words tools into existing community networks.
    - >
      The group is working with community partners and families to design these tools and define the role of what they call a Family Learning Coach. The exchange aims to create workshops and activities to support learning using Playful Words tools, help Family Learning Coaches learn to facilitate child and parent engagement, create tutoring programs to support early learning, and incorporate StoryBlocks literacy tools into storytime for children and families.

      The <a href="http://scratchx.org/">ScratchX</a> team is building experimental extensions to <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, a programming language and online community for creating your own interactive stories, games, and animations. ScratchX extensions allow you to connect your Scratch projects to external hardware such as the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-101">Arduino/Genuino 101</a> board with a built in tilt sensor and Bluetooth connectivity to interface your projects with the physical world.
    - >
      During this residency exchange, the ScratchX team will work with librarians from <a href="http://www.richlandlibrary.com/">Richland Library</a> to create new programs for teaching novice coders, develop documentation and toolkits for existing activities, identify new ScratchX tools that would be valuable for community learning, and test a train-the-trainer workshop to help interested librarians feel comfortable facilitating these activities in their communities.

#       We’re exploring an exchange between the Media Lab’s <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/space-exploration/overview/">Space Exploration Initiative</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/cpl.aspx">Cambridge Public Library</a>, and <a href="https://www.cmlibrary.org/">Charlotte Mecklenburg Library</a>. This team is hoping to build on STEM and climate-related outreach programs that the Space Initiative has been piloting with Boston-area youth. Together, they aim to create materials and workshops for libraries to engage community members with space exploration technologies and STEM learning. The details of this residency exchange are still in development, so stay tuned for updates!
